MicroCRM is to tracking these potential contacts as what TaskPaper is to GTD - dead simple.   MicroCRM (CRM stands for Client Relationship Management btw) is really cool because of what I’ve come to define as “progression.” Basically, you add Leads into MicroCRM - people who have the potential to be a future client. Once you’ve landed some work with that client, you then move them into a Jobs category. When the job is finished, that person is progressed into a final Invoices section. Once the cash is in hand, the contact is then removed from MicroCRM, thus removing the need to manage that individual anymore. It’s incredibly easy to use.
